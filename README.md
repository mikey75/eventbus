Simple publish/subscribe fire-and-forget event bus, written primarily for exchanging events in Swing apps 
within multiple windows/panels. Not meant for a great volume of events and concurrent work. 
Pretty rudimentary stuff, with no ambition to become a universal event bus. Use at your own risk :)
